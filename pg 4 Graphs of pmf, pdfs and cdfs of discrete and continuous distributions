# Aim: Creating graphs of PMF (probability mass function),
# PDF (probability density function) and CDF (cumulative
# distributive function)

# Program:

# command # PDF and CDF are normal
X <- Seq(-3, 3, 1)
Plot(X, dnorm(X), type = 'l', col = 'Red')
Plot(X, pnorm(X), type = 'l', col = 'Green')

# PMF for binomials
dbinom(0:10, size = 10, Prob = 0.5)
barplot(dbinom(0:10, size = 10, Prob = 0.5))
