## b) Continuous Distribution: Normal Distribution

# 1. Set parameters
mu <- 0     # Mean
sigma <- 1  # Standard Deviation

# 2. Define the domain (x-values)
# Create a sequence of values from -4 to 4 with a step of 0.1
x_continuous <- seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.1)

# 3. Calculate PDF (Probability Density Function)
# dnorm gives the density f(x)
pdf_continuous <- dnorm(x_continuous, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
print("PDF values (Density f(x)):")
print(pdf_continuous[1:5]) # Print first 5 values for brevity

# 4. Calculate CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
# pnorm gives the cumulative probability P(X <= x)
cdf_continuous <- pnorm(x_continuous, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
print("CDF values (Cumulative Probability P(X <= x)):")
print(cdf_continuous[1:5]) # Print first 5 values for brevity

# 5. Plot the PDF (Density Curve)
# type="l" creates a line plot, appropriate for continuous data
plot(x_continuous, pdf_continuous, 
     type = "l", # Line plot
     lwd = 2,    # Line width
     col = "blue", # Line color
     main = "PDF of Normal Distribution (mu=0, sigma=1)",
     xlab = "x",
     ylab = "Density (f(x))"
)
grid()

# 6. Plot the CDF (S-shaped Curve)
# type="l" creates a line plot
plot(x_continuous, cdf_continuous, 
     type = "l", # Line plot
     lwd = 2,    # Line width
     col = "red", # Line color
     main = "CDF of Normal Distribution (mu=0, sigma=1)",
     xlab = "x",
     ylab = "Cumulative Probability (P(X<=x))"
)
grid()
